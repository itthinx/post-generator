The Simpsons

Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Human contact: the final frontier. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.

Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.

Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Me fail English? That's unpossible. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"

I was saying "Boo-urns." I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."

Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

…And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.

Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.

Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. D'oh. Thank you, steal again. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.

Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children…

Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Please do not offer my god a peanut. Please do not offer my god a peanut. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!

Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.

Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train!

Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.

But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life. D'oh. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.

Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! Please do not offer my god a peanut. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.

I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.

Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.

Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."

Futurama

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… It must be wonderful.

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

I'm Santa Claus! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Hello Morbo, how's the family? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
It's a T. It goes "tuh".
There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!
OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

Kids have names? I just told you! You've killed me! Noooooo! Shut up and get to the point!

In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Kif might! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

So, how 'bout them Knicks? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Anyone who laughs is a communist! I had more, but you go ahead.

Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? And why did 'I' have to take a cab? How much did you make me? They're like sex, except I'm having them! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

Oh right. I forgot about the battle. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Say it in Russian! I'll get my kit! I can explain. It's very valuable.";

Monthy Python and the Holy Grail

What do you mean? A newt? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Well, I didn't vote for you.

Did you dress her up like this? Camelot! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

Well, I got better. She looks like one. Well, she turned me into a newt. What a strange person. Well, what do you want?

Well, how'd you become king, then? Burn her anyway! Bring her forward! Well, I got better. Well, I didn't vote for you. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

I dunno. Must be a king. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, we did do the nose. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! I'm not a witch.

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

Who's that then? It's only a model. I dunno. Must be a king. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! What do you mean?

Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Burn her anyway! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

Well, how'd you become king, then? We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Camelot! It's only a model. Where'd you get the coconuts? Burn her!

How do you know she is a witch? I'm not a witch. Be quiet! Camelot!

The nose? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! What do you mean? Shut up! Now, look here, my good man. Now, look here, my good man.

I have to push the pram a lot. Where'd you get the coconuts? Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! But you are dressed as one… Now, look here, my good man.

Did you dress her up like this? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! We want a shrubbery!! You don't vote for kings. I dunno. Must be a king. Now, look here, my good man.

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! We want a shrubbery!! Well, I got better. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical!

Well, what do you want? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Shut up! Will you shut up?! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

We want a shrubbery!! I'm not a witch. Well, I didn't vote for you. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Burn her anyway!

I'm not a witch. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

A newt? Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! You don't vote for kings. Did you dress her up like this?

The nose? Well, what do you want? Camelot! How do you know she is a witch? It's only a model.
