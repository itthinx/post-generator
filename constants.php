You mean it controls your actions?
Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What?!
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him, alone.
I\'m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Don\'t act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren\'t on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
But with the blast shield down, I can\'t even see!
How am I supposed to fight?
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There\'s nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.
I\'m getting too old for this sort of thing.
I\'m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Don\'t act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren\'t on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
You\'re all clear, kid.
Let\'s blow this thing and go home!
As you wish.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There\'s nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
What?!
What good is a reward if you ain\'t around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station ain\'t my idea of courage.
It\'s more like ... suicide.
Ye-ha!

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
On second thoughts, let\'s not go there.
It is a silly place.
Why do you think that she is a witch?
The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.
Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
It\'s only a model.
What do you mean?
The nose?

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit ... that\'s why I\'m transferring to business school!
Shut up and get to the point!
No!
Don\'t jump!
The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!
Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
It\'s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus.
All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV.

While their products leave much to be desired, Acme delivery service is second to none;
Wile E. can merely drop an order into a mailbox (or enter an order on a website, as in the Looney Tunes: Back in Action movie), and have the product in his hands within seconds.
The name Acme became popular for businesses by the 1920s, when alphabetized business telephone directories such as the Yellow Pages began to be widespread.

A battery, providing the power source for the phone functions.
An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone.
The most common input mechanism is a keypad, but touch screens are also found in some high-end smartphones.
A screen which echoes the user\'s typing, displays text messages, contacts and more.
Basic mobile phone services to allow users to make calls and send text messages.
All GSM phones use a SIM card to allow an account to be swapped among devices.
Some CDMA devices also have a similar card called a R-UIM.
Individual GSM, WCDMA, iDEN and some satellite phone devices are uniquely identified by an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.
FooPhone is an attempt to develop a mobile phone which contains only Foo.

Caution! May contain Peanuts!

In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, oranges, grapes, strawberries, bananas, and lemons.
On the other hand, the botanical sense of "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, and tomatoes.

Some vegetables also contain fiber, important for gastrointestinal function.
Vegetables contain important nutrients necessary for healthy hair and skin as well.
A person who refrains from dairy and meat products, and eats only plants (including vegetables) is known as a vegan.
Some vegetables can be consumed raw, while some, such as cassava, must be cooked to destroy certain natural toxins or microbes in order to be edible.
A number of processed food items available on the market contain vegetable ingredients and can be referred to as "vegetable derived" products.
These products may or may not maintain the nutritional integrity of the vegetable used to produce them.
Of all the world\'s nations, China is the leading cultivator of vegetables, with top productions in potato, onions, cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes and broccoli.
The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks.
While it is botanically a fruit, it is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes (as well as under U.S. customs regulations, see Nix v. Hedden), which has caused some confusion.
The fruit is rich in lycopene, which may have beneficial health effects.

iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.

The first generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007; the most recent iPhones, the seventh-generation iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S, were introduced on September 10, 2013.
The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc., and now in its third generation.
