[1] I was not unaware, Brutus, when he, the teaching of the philosophers, which is a Greek word tractavissent exquisitaque the greatest genius, that we committed in Latin literature, as in this case would be to incur the censures of our labor in the various. for to some, not very popular, and to those, indeed, the whole of this is displeasing to philosophize. Some of them find fault with is not so much that, if it is a question more tolerable, and so a lot of care must be in it, but they did not think the study. , will also be, and those of the learned Greek, Latin, despising, the reading of the work of those who say that they prefer to consume in the Greek. At last, I suspect that there would be some, who call me to the other letters, this type of writing, even though it was elegant, and dignity of the person, however, they do not recognize.

[2] On the other hand it must be all of whom had a brief, I think. However, a sufficient answer to the revilers of philosophy, indeed, the book in which philosophy has been defended and praised by us, though he was charged with, and found fault with by Hortensius. he who was free when he is tried, he seemed to them to do with thee, and I will be able to judge, I would suppose that, more than I have undertaken the study of men, fearing lest he should seem to move, can no longer hold. But which, if you were to be satisfied with a more prudent, however, that will to be done, a kind of self-control demand in the difficult to the fact that they can not be reprimique Once that is admitted to be restrained, as they are almost the just use these things, it withdraws us from the philosophy of that at all, than to those who may be constituted in the manner of the things of the infinite and the proper form, because of the better, the greater it is, the midpoint of to them.

[3] For whether we are able to arrive to the wisdom, it does not need to prepare it for ourselves alone, but to be enjoyed by the [wisdom] is; whether this is hard to get any research, nor the manner is, however, of truth, you do not find, if fatigue is unclean, and to seek, when it is, that which is sought, to be beautiful. In fact, if we take pleasure, when the Scribes, who is so envious, those who belong to him: and we take her? But if you work hard, who is it who had had no way to set up an industry? For example, Terence Chremes not cruel, a new neighbor who does not wish to bear, finally, to dig or plow, or the '- For it was from industry, but from the fear of a disingenuous effort -, this is how they were curious, and unpopular with us, whom he meets at least our work.

[4] And they were touched is more difficult enough to do, as they say in Latin, to make light of. under which it is for the first time is that in which not surprised, why not to take pleasure in the dramatic picture just painted them, the word of the fathers, when they set out the same stories about the Greeks, but not against the word from the Latin to read. almost to the name of an enemy of the Roman, who so is, or Antiope Medea of ​​Ennius Pacuvius who despise or reject in turn, take pleasure in the stories that he says the same of Euripides, Latin letters hate the good?

Comrades, I said, rather than both Menander Terence Andrian Younger or someone else?

[5] They only differ from him; that, when he wrote the best way or the Electra of Sophocles, to read to me, I think, however, turned over to the benches, of whom Lucilius: 'the writer of iron', but, in my opinion, the writer, however, it is to be read. Inexperienced or tedious, I shall not believe that there is a want of energy in our poets, or something of some indolent delicatissimi. they seem to me to have learned enough to no one, in which our ignorant of all this. an 'Oh that the woodman. . . we read of nothing less than this is the same Greek copies, which are discussed by Plato about being a good and happy life, this will not be pleased to explain in Latin?

[6] What? performs the office of interpreters if they do not, but we will feed it, what has been said by those whom he approves, and to give the order of writing of us, our judgment, and add the, what is there, why the Greeks to prefer those things which have been transformed with all dignity and said, so that neither of the Greeks? For if they say that the matter has to be treated by them, so that they themselves do not the Greeks, why it was so many delegates, and which are to be read. for it is passed over in what the Stoics by Chrysippus? we read, however, in comparison with Diogenes, Antipater, dissatisfied with, Panaetium, and many others, our friend Posidonius in the first place. What? Theophrastus mediocriterne delighted to deal with the topics treated by Aristotle before? What? The same whether they abandoned the idea of ​​the Epicureans, and of whom it is written by the ancients, and Epicurus, by the judgment of his own to write? other things are read by the Greeks, the Greeks of the same reason, can develop if, what is it, why they are not studied by our men?

[7] And yet, as if In this way it change the face of Plato or Aristotle, as I have rendered our fables of the poets, it is bad, I suppose, I might deserve of my people, if you should transfer to the recognition of the divine intellects. not to me, nor have I done that yet, but still, that I should do, it was forbidden to you. Indeed such a place some, if you please, I will carry, and to be the most, whom I have just mentioned, and, when there happens, so that it can be done properly, that they may see the names of Ennius, Afranius from Menander did used to be. Nor, indeed, as our friend Lucilius, refuse, to prevent my read. I wish that it should be Persius, Scipio and Rutilius and even more so, of which he says that he is, and to acquiesce in the judgment of the Tarentines, fearing both the Sicilians to write. Facete is, indeed, just as the other; No, nor yet both the learned and were then alive, he worked the subject of judgment, and they are the letters of the milder ones, that they may appear to the greatest courtesy, the doctrine of the average.

[8] I have the reader, whom should I fear, when I dare to write to you, even to the Greeks fell back into the philosophy of? What shall I do, though, provoked a most welcome to me, that the book of the same from you, whom you sent to me from the power of the. But it is from the use of some, then I believe him to come; to shrink back from the Latins, that they have fallen into a kind of desolate and savage, and for the ills of the Greek into Latin the writings of something worse. such things as I agree with you, so long as you think of the same things, even to the Greeks were to be chosen. said the good man, and those things does not read the words of the choice of a weighty and brilliant? wishes to be said, but he who boasts of having the Greek, as well as a place in my praetorship Scaevola, was greeted at Athens Albucius.

[9] We, too sale, and of all the beauty of the place be entrusted to the same Lucilius many things, the one who was an excellent Scaevola observed:

Greek te, Albuci, the Roman and the Sabine,
of the municipal town of Pontus, Tritan, Centurion,
distinguished men and first signiferumque,
preferred to be called. Therefore, the Greek consul in Athens
that which you preferred, you, when you came to me, you come to visit:
'Chaere,' I say, 'Tite!' sergeants, company every chorus:
'Chaere, Tite!' on the one side of the enemy, my Albucius, on the one side the enemy.
[10] But let us swear Mucius. I have to wonder [enough] I am unable to whence is this to be so insolent a disgust at all things domestic. the place is not at all the same is to be taught; but I feel it so often spoken in order, not only to the Latin language, the not so helpless, as is commonly thought, but also that it is richer than the Greeks. when it is related to us, the goods or the poets or the orator, or should I say, then, indeed, that which was simulated, was wanting to the furniture of any prayer or lights or a fair? I am, however, that the practice at the bar, his labors, I seem to have abandoned the defense of dangers, not by, in which I was placed by the Roman people, ought to be, of course, insofar as I can, in fact, also, to work out, that they may be, and zeal, my fellow citizens, more learned than all my labor, and not with the men; to fight so much, they would prefer to read from Greek, and now they say that the things he does, do not pretend to do, and those who serve, those who wish to make use of the letters of the two, or, if they have their own, that they are is of little use to them.

[11] But those who prefer to be written by us other things, just to them that they ought to be, there are many, which was also written, so that no more of our men, and deeds will be perhaps more, if life allows; And yet he who diligently these words, order of philosophy, that is, to read assueverit, no judge from reading to be more excellent. with so much to search for than what is written in the life of all in the philosophy, and then, too, that in these books, the question is, who is to be the end, what is the last time, what was the ultimate, must not be considered the point of reference when they are of all things living well and rightly, the highest a nature as to what follows from things expetendis, what to avoid misery? In this regard, since it is the most profound difference between the most learned men, who as foreign to the dignity of his nostrils are they, each man to give to him rather than to me, the best and the most true it is that this is all a gift of life, to seek a?

[12] Or, is it not that in the fruit of the birth of the slave woman be considered, discussed more among the rulers of the city, P. Scaevola M'.que Manilius, Marcus Brutus, by those licenses - for the use of the citizens, and not the kind of useless because it was high, and we are written therein: and in the rest of the same kind and with great pleasure, and we will read a -, these words, which contain the whole of life, ignore the for, as being the things that vendibiliora, surely there are more circumstantial accounts of these things. though that will be allowed to think that those, who read it.

[13] Further, as the most easy of let us begin with, on the first come in the midst of Epicurus system, which is well known to most people. before we understand the matter thus, let us, in order that by those who approve of the training, they are not more accurately explained; we wish to find the truth, not as an adversary to convict someone. with more care it formerly been constructed by Lucius Torquatus, a man of the doctrine of the wise, that he defended the opinion of Epicurus' about pleasure, recommended by me, to him, were told that when C. Triarius, a young man of character and learning in the first place, the interest of the discussion to him.

[14] In fact, both of them had come to pay their respects when it comes to me in the neighborhood of Cumae, the first among us a few words about the letter, and the sums of the two was in the study, and then, Torquatus: For Having got possession of thee, said he, we are idle at any time, at any rate I will hear, what it is, what the Epicureans our , though you have not hated blood, so that they usually do, those who belong to him as, but I'm sure you do not approve, but I saw a man whom I am, I think, one of the most important, and all the errors of the mind of men, he is to be treated, which be part of the good and happy life. but think that you, as our Triarius, the less I be pleased by them, that the opinion of Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, of prayer, ornaments neglected to do so. For one thing is to be brought with difficulty can not, in order that, as he knows he is, you may not seem to be true.

[15] See, as much as, I say, may be deceived, O Torquatus. the philosophers of this style I have no fault to find for and embraces the words of the, what he wants, and he says plainly, I can understand; I am a philosopher, and yet, if he shall bring his eloquence, I will not despise, if he does not, he is not greatly insist on it. , to me it is not so satisfactory, and, indeed, in several places. but as there are men, so many opinions; Therefore, we can not be deceived.

For this reason, think, then, is not satisfactory? I think I have a fair, provided that he is well acquainted with what to say.

[16] Except to me, Phaedrus, I say, I have lied, of Zeno, do you think you are, both of which, I have heard, of course, with me alone, in addition to the industry of the truth thereof, they are all well known to me the opinion of Epicurus. , and to those, whom I have mentioned, when often we hear from our friend Atticus, expressed surprise at that too on both sides, the Phaedrus is also a love, every day among us, those things which we were hearing, conferred, as stated, and there was never a controversy, why should I understand that, but what he did.

[17] What, then, is it? says; thought I wish to listen to, what you do not approve. In the first place, I say, in physics, in which the glory in this, for the first time is a stranger to the whole. Democritea changing, says the very few in number, but in such a way that those things which to correct this, it seems to me to have such questions. that which he calls atoms, that is, the bodies of the individuals on account of the solidity of the Bible, maintains that in the infinite empty space, in which there is neither the lowest nor the highest, nor the middle, nor the end is not the last to bear it so, that they may cohere in the encounters, with each other, which may be made from the things that exist and that can be discerned in , all things, and that no one from the beginning of the motion of atoms, but it to be understood from all eternity in the time to come together.

[18] Epicurus on the other, in which it follows that Democritus, he does not come tumbling down. although each of them with many things I do not approve, as well as that in the first place, that, when they are to be sought in the realm of nature there are two, one, that matter may be, out of which all things are made, and the other, which force is, and what the effect of which is, the matter of the discussions in the power and cause of production left. but this is a common vice, those of Epicurus, of one's own ruin, for he considers that the same part of the individuals, and the solid bodies to be borne downwards by its own weight to a line, this natural movement of the body, being of all things.

[19] Then, in the same place an acute man, when I shall ocurreret, all up and down, from a straight line, and if, as I have said, to a line, ** will never be brought as an atom, therefore, the other thing, the other could not attain by utopia is: very little to avoid the doctrine of atoms and said, that he could not be made or less; adhesions of conjunction of atoms constituting the embraces, and with each other, the world and all the parts of the world from the time when he would have become, and what was in him. And since this is the whole thing (is) sincere children, and also not to make [it], that he wishes to. for it is supposed to, and she is the declination to the lust - for he says, without a cause to turn aside the doctrine of atoms; which there is nothing more shameful in the physical as it is possible to say anything without a cause, - and the latter is a natural motion of all the weights, so that he himself has established, and the atoms of the lower region of the place of those who ask, and yet it is delivered without a cause, the cause of these things of which he had devised, achieved this end.

[20] In fact, if all the atoms swerve, no one can ever cohaerescent, or others, turn aside, and others for that right to be moved, for the first time it shall be, as it were, to give the atoms of the provinces, which is a straight line, which is oblique to be passed, and then the other, that the atomic theory, Democritus, too, in which the sticks, this could not become the adornment of the world and the disorderly crowd. You have not even a physical, to believe in anything to be the least, this was of course never countrymen, if a Polyaenus, his intimate friend, because he, too, is a geometric preferred to learn them better. Sun Democritus seems great, since man learned in geometriaque perfect, this measure may be; to that extent he thinks that he is, as can be seen, or a little more and to have more, or less.

[21] In this way, which is changed, it is destructive, which is the result of the whole of Democritus, atoms, void, the images, which eidola year terms, with the invasion of not only see, but also to think about it; eternity itself which, accurate, they call it, the whole of Him, as well as innumerable of the world, who every day, and they rise and perish. Yet even if I could in no manner it can be, praised Democritus, however, from the other it is said, the one who followed him, he did not want to blamed.

[22] Now in the other philosophical point of view. which is to seek, in its own, which logikh we say, This your plane, so that it seems to me, unarmed and naked, it is. takes the definitions, no dividing and dividing, not how effective concludaturque system reports, which can not be discharged via deceitful shows distinct fluctuations; of things in the judgments of the senses, which can be proved if it is a single event has been falsity instead of truth, of truth, and has given all judgment is falsely supposed to be taken away.

[23] confirmed this in particular, that the very nature, as he says, sciscat, and approve of, that is, the pleasure and pain. Let us flee from these things, and to refer everything and the things which are to be imitated. And though it is a Cyrenaicisque of Aristippus, the better and more freely to support this, however, is of such a judgment, for man to see that none of the less noble. For greater things are, that we conformed to the nature of the birth and, as it seems to me. and can it be that I err, but it is precisely of that opinion, was not allowed to Torquatus, who at first gave the name of him, to have to draw down, either from a necklace that with the enemies, in order to take any of the perceived pleasure by the body, or with the Latins, for the sake of the pleasure of his third Consulship, and attacked at the Veseris; If it is delivered to the executioner, the son of, it seems to many that they had also privavisse pleasures, since they preferred the love of the nature of the right to the dignity and authority of his father.

[24] What? T. Torquatus, who as consul with Cn. Octavius ​​was, the severity of, for the son when he has made use of, which, in the adoption of Decimus Silanus emancipaverat, to put him to the prosecution of the ambassadors of the Macedonians, and had argued that the money should be sent to the province, the proper form of the cause to himself, he would be seen to have been in on both sides, such that he is not heard to proclaim that the the command of, the quality of his city, the present, and as he forbade anyone to come into his presence, did you think about the pleasures of their own thoughts?

But in order to say nothing of the dangers, labors, the sufferings, too, the best of each one in his own language, and on behalf of his, whom I may be found not only lack in this, but also to pass all the pleasures, pains, finally, to accept, rather than to give up any part of any of the office of the things, which does not less to be, but seem to be less important, let us come.

[25] What do you have, O Torquatus, to what shall befall this Triarius of the letter, what do the histories of things to investigate, from the poets, the development of the, what brings so much pleasure the memory of so many verses? it not to me that you have said, 'For this is the same to me, they are for pleasure, and were those Torquato.' You should never argue in defense of Epicurus nor Metrodorus, or any of them, this one, either in his wisdom, or something he had been taught. And what is asked many times, why it was so many of them are the Epicureans, and there are also other causes, the most appealing but the multitude of these things, they think that it is so called from him, right and honorable, what they are, it can do so itself, by itself, bring joy, and that is, Pleasure. be stripped of they do not understand the whole concept of the best of men, if it so the thing is. for if it were to be conceded, even if nothing is to be referred to the body, of his own accord, and by this that he is pleasant to you, and the power, and the knowledge of what is to be, the last thing he wants is to be desired.

[26] This, then, I do not approve of Epicurus, I say. For the rest, I wish I would have Himself committed His doctrine or, indeed, well equipped with - for it is, is the need to be seen as you are, I will not be adequately polished by those arts, which they who hold that the learned are called - or you do not deterred others from studies. Although you can not see it being intimidated.

This being the case, I would appeal more naturally than that He was speaking to him, as well as Triarius gently smiled and said: You are in fact, he said, almost the whole of Epicurus, who have carried from the choir of the philosophers. What is left to him, save of thee, speak in any way, to understand, what he was saying? Other people 's physical, neither the things he said in the same place, which we approve of them; if he wanted to make that straight, which in the case of, worse than he did. the art had no. pleasure is the supreme good as well, for the first time at the very moment he saw a little, and then the same token, this; : because previous to Aristippus, and he can better. have been added at the end of even among the unlearned.

[27] It is, I say, Triarius, can in no way be changed; that they should not tell you what you do not approve of Him by whom disagree. For what is it to be an Epicurean, I should have, if it was, that he had to say? especially those with learning the game it was. For this reason, blame any one of those disagreeing among themselves, they are blamed like it, 'cursed is the, insults, as well as of anger, contentions, and unworthy of the philosophy to me concertationesque are always considered to be pertinacious in disputing.

[28] Thereupon Torquatus said: No doubt, he said, I give assent; the obstinacy of temper, or be maintained, without rebuke, nor right, nor with their view might be maintained. But at this, unless it is disagreeable, I have, which I would like to. Did you think, I say, if not you would like to learn one, you think this is going to tell that? Whether the question is, therefore, to be traversed with the pleasure of the whole or of one of Epicurus, is pleasing to the discipline, in which all the competition is? You, however, it did not come, I say, feel free to. Thus will I do, then, he says, will unfold in one thing, and the greatest, of physics at other times, and even be able to try, and the decline of the size of the sun, and that of atoms of Democritus and Epicurus, criticized and corrected from the errors of many. now I speak of the pleasure, that is nothing new, but with this, I will prove that you are to be the same trust.

[29] At all events, I say, it will not be to you, if I will approve of those things which thou shalt say, I will willingly assent to the opinion. I will prove it, he said, the way in which you want to justice, and I pointed out. But rather than use the speech to ask or be asked. I like to say. Then he began to speak. In the first place, then, he said, and so I, the author of this discipline, so that they may please, I will make, what it is and what it is that we are investigating, not because I want you to think that, but in order to the reason and the way of a prayer. therefore I ask, what is the last, and the last of the good, of all the philosophers and in agreement that there ought to be such, must be referred to in order to reduce all things to itself, however, by no means. Epicurus, in the pleasure of this-namely, that they wish to be the supreme good and the supreme evil, pain, and instituted to teach in this way:

[30] And every beast, and at the same time is destined to, and enjoy, as the desire of the supreme good, the evil, and the pain of rejection, as the highest, as much as possible, do away with, and that was distorted by the very nature to be faithful, and I do not yet fully determined. on account of the work, either in argument, therefore, he says, show that pleasure is to be desired, to be avoided at dolor sit. can not men perceive that they are, so that the fire is hot, the snow is white ', the sweet honey. none of which ought to be studied to confirm, only to be enough to remind us. the difference between the argument is syllogistic reasoning and moderate punishment and warning. be opened, and, as it were a kind of wrapped in the secrets of the other, and the other hand, and are open to be judged. For the rest of the senses, because nothing is taken from the man, it is necessary, or to the nature of or contrary to what He is, by nature itself is to be judged. what it perceives or what does it indicate in which either seek or avoid something, in addition to pleasure and pain?

[31] There are, however, some of our own, who wish to commit all these things, and they refuse to, enough to be more subtle, on what is good or what is evil, with the feeling to be judged, but also in mind and be able to understand the nature of the pain and the pleasure of it in relation to the sacrament itself is to be avoided, and that he is to be sought . So say this as a natural and inherent in our minds the idea that there might be another desire, another despicable experience. Others, however, such things as I agree with you, with a number of a great deal of by the philosophers, I will explain why it is not to be counted neither in the evil in the good pleasure of the pain, we do not think that should be too much reason to confide in, or amended, but also from the pleasure and pain of arguing on the reasons for and accurately discuss the subject of dispute, and they think.

[32] But I must explain to you, you how all this mistaken idea of ​​denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born, and the whole account of the system itself, and the teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness, explain to you. for no one can obtain pain of itself, because it is pleasure, rejects, dislikes, or fled, but because they belong to the great sorrows of those who know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter; nor would any person belonging to, pain that, for there to be dolor, amet, consectetur, to obtain, but because non numquam eius modi tempora, as I have some great labor and sorrow, to seek pleasure. in order to come to the smallest things, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault, who wishes to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that, produces no resultant pleasure?

[33] But I hate them, and they are bringing against the just, and worthy of the general, who, corrupted by the flattery of the present and of pleasure deleniti, excepturi of these pains, and troubles, which are, not blinded by the desire to betake himself, and in the same chapter be at fault who fulfill an office they deserted the general weakness of spirit, that is, labor and painful. simple and easy, and in fact the distinction of these. For your free time, when our power of choice to choose, and when nothing prevents it, the less it is, that which is most pleasing to God, we may be able to do, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. the needs of the times and in certain circumstances and the duty or often come to pass, that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. is kept by the wise man, therefore, selected for these matters to this, so that he rejects pleasures to secure other greater or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

[34] This I hold the above opinion when, what reason is there why I am afraid, I can not answer to it, to adapt Torquatos our fathers? a little while ago, when in memory of whom thou art, as well as a friendly and with good will towards us, you have brought together, less energy and will not take me to the answer, however, restored to the praise of the corrupted of my ancestry. of whom she became how it is, I pray you, you explain the? the way you think of them, or in the blood of an armed enemy, and in the violence of his children, both of them, or in the cruel and had found nothing as his own, and to reflect the interests of some of the nothing? this must not be at what they do, so they can make, therefore, be confused by, that they may not understand what they are for, that abundance of their movements, you are so you think so many men of eminence who had conducted their operations in vain?

[35] What was the reason, as soon as I see; In the mean time this right, this if for one reason, which is, without doubt, the excellent things, and if not, not to have been the cause of the power of them by itself. - Chain, and put the enemy. - And, indeed, he himself, lest you perish. - At great danger. - In the eyes of the army. - What would you obtain? - And the love of the praise of the, which belong to the life without the fear of living and protection of the most powerful. - Son of the death tax. - If a man without cause, from me, did not want to, because of the sun, so impertinent and cruel, But, to their sorrow, to ratify the military discipline of the army in the war grave contained the fear of punishment, safety and prosperity of its citizens, which is understood to be contained. and this method is widely evident.

[36] And in the prayer of the day that the most of all that he is accustomed to boast of your own, your own, especially, who diligently pursue the old, clear, and the commemoration of the brave men and their deeds, not an advantage to any one, but has also the honor, the glory of the praise of the, the choice of things that will be totally swept out by him, of whom I spake, on putting in , to attain to the cause of pleasure and pain to that of our ancestors, are to be received shall be omitted or the greater the pains and pleasures of effugiendorum grace.

[37] But it is of enough for the aged, in this place, it is said, by his illustrious deeds of famous men. there shall be proper for the pleasure of the course of the discussion of all the virtues of the place already. now, however, explain the treatment of the pleasure itself which is a, this error is of ignorant intellegaturque it might be taken away, which is a voluptuous, delicate, soft is to be considered training which they had rich meaning that is containing it, how severe it is. For it is not we follow in this case alone, which is perceived by the sweetness of any one of the senses of the nature of the will moves itself and with joy, but the greatest pleasure that we have, all the pain has been removed, which is perceived, for, that, by depriving him of the pain, the emptiness of all the hardships of the liberation and rejoice in, every thing, with which we rejoice, the pleasure is to say, that of all which offends us, pain, the absence of all pain is the pleasure of what we rightly call. in order that, being driven away with the hunger and thirst of food and drink is to say, what has been said brings the attainment of pleasure, discomfort, so the succession of the removal of the causes of pain in any thing of pleasure.

[38], therefore, does not accept them to be anything between the midst of the pain and the pleasure of Epicurus; since the same thing, that in some places means they could see, with all the pain, be deprived of, to be not only pleasure, but also the greatest pleasure in. whoever he feels, which in the manner of a man, or him it is necessary to be in pleasure or in pain. Everyone thinks that the removal of pain, Epicurus terminated greatest pleasure to be changed pleasure distinguique can not be increased amplificarique.

[39] But, also, to come out of my father used to ridiculing of the Stoics, wit and elegance, in the Cerameicus there is a statue of Chrysippus sitting with an outstretched hand, signifies the hand which gave him the delight to be in this argument: 'Does your hand, which is now affected by the manner of, desires? ' - Nothing really. - 'But, if pleasure were a good object of his desire.' - Yes, I believe. - 'It is not, then, the pleasure of a good thing.' This, indeed, is going to tell the father, he said, not even a statue, if it could speak. it was concluded that it is contrary to a Cyrenaic position, it has none whatsoever against Epicurus. if we judge only for the pleasure of it would be, as it were, titillaret the sense of which is, so to speak, with a doleful lamentation, and to them, abounded, and would slip into, any part of it nor the hand one could be content with the motion of a pleasant freedom from pain without pleasure. And if the highest pleasure is, as Epicurus holds, feel no pain, well then, Chrysippus, the, nothing more has been granted to his hand, and when he had been affected, according to no one's regret, if pleasure were a good, would have wanted it. this is why you did not want it, that he was precisely to be in pleasure.

[40] This is the last, however, be very easy to see that the good pleasure which comes from this: Let someone from the great many people, both in mind and body, enjoying the pleasures of any pain or being hindered by the continuous or lowering, the state of praestabiliorem or more to be desired, and what will be able to say this? it is necessary that there is in him, who has this disposition, and the firmness of the man's death, neither sorrow, fears, in that the death of no sensation, pain in the length of the light it is, usually with what is important to be short, so that the speed of its greatness, of the length of allevatio comfort.

[41] The answer to this, when it comes near, nor receive the Divine, that the remembrance of the divinity of the constant dread of these or allow to flow out: let the pleasures of the past, what is it that a woman can be, that it is better, to approach You? Set up against any man, the pains of the body is made of is only a mind, how can a man of the greatest fall, there would be no hope of the, saying, at any time, there is no waiting for, moreover, neither in the present nor the pleasure, what can be more wretched than can be said or imagined? But if you are filled with pain and the most fled from, is of fundamental evil is to live with pain, with which opinion is in keeping with the last of a good things to him to the pleasures of life. I do not have anything in our mind, where it, as of the end of the, and all the pain and fear and illnesses, and they are referred to, there was no other is the most, from its own nature, or be able to tamper with, or anger.

[42] Furthermore, it is the beginning of a campaign, set of things or by the desire of pleasure and to the avoiding, or at all, and instead of sorrow. And when this is the case, it is evident that all be referred to the praise of the Lord about the matter and, with pleasure, that we are living. even the last of the good, that is, either the highest or the extreme, that - what the Greeks call telos -, that it had no other object, they are referred to what a thing of all, we must say that there is a supreme good to be pleasant to live.

Those who let him ask in one of the nature of the power of what they do not understand, and were captivated by the splendor of his name, the error of the greatest, if not wish to hear the doctrine of Epicurus, be saved: but, for these are the pleasure of making your virtues, unless exceptional and well, who is to be praised are adjusted either in or expetendas was at stake? not to the knowledge of the science of the physician, but of a good on account of health, as the pilot 's art, because it is the main reason in all this, usefulness, not by art, is praised, so is wisdom, which is to be regarded as the art of living, I will not be asked, if you would be unavailing; now sought as an artist, which is collected and compared pleasure -

[43] but I will tell you more pleasure, Do you see now, do not the envy of the word, and my prayer came to a fall -. is troubled with the ignorance of what is good and what is bad, for the life of men, often are not deprived of the greatest pleasures, and on account of the cruellest of the soul is grieved, and the error of him to torture, in wisdom, is to be used, the rashness of these things, and the terrors of the pin and of false opinions and desires of the most certain, and of all deductions are made, to give for the pleasure of himself to us make a captain. For the wisdom of is one since it pushes out of the hearts of sorrow, not to let the fear of the things that we exhorrescere. which form teacher living in tranquility can break all the heat is extinguished. desires, for they are never satisfied, which is not only individual men, but by all members of a family, the whole often also destroy the state.

[44] from the cupidities of hatred, and discord, strife, seditions, wars are born, and do not only boast that these are held in the streets of a blind rush to an offense, not only to others, but within they are discordant, and even in the soul, are to be at variance with each other, it is necessary to source of its life amarissimam brought to completion, only the emptiness of all that was cut off, and an error of nature, as a wise circumcisaque satisfied with the boundaries and be able to live without fear and without being tried by illness.

[45] For what is more suitable for a partition of a good life, or it is more useful than the other, or to, the use of which is the principle of Epicurus? of them who share the one race he established, desires, which may be both natural and necessary, and the other, which are natural, however, there would be neither necessary, and the third, which is neither natural nor necessary. whose reason for this is the work of many not feel an expense to be necessary, or even accomplished by them, truly is great, that the natural desire, because it is the very nature of riches, with which it is satisfied with, and has the affordable and it is terminated; nor the desire of empty and no end of any method can be found.
